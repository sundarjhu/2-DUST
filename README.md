# 2-DUST
2-DUST is a general-purpose dust radiative transfer code for an axisymmetric system that reveals the global energetics of dust grains in the shell and the 2-D projected morphologies of the shell that are strongly dependent on the mixed effects of the axisymmetric dust distribution and inclination angle. It can be used to model a variety of axisymmetric astronomical dust systems.

Please read 2-Dust: A Dust Radiative Transfer Code for an Axisymmetric System by Ueta, T., & Meixner, M. for a detailed explanation of the code (2003, ApJ, 586, 1338)
