INPUT:
--------
?.dat: This file contains the running parameters for the task and has the following form:

NRAD 	NQ							#Number radial grids, Number of quadrature grids
MXSTEP	VSPACE							#max step number allowed, spacing factor for 
									step size (decrease for larger size)
DFLAG	SFLAG	BFLAG						#mass/number density(mass den=0), 
									scattering (iso=0, aniso=1),
									bicone opening (none=0,1=bicone)
Rstar[Rsun]   Tstar 						#stellar radius (Rsun), Tstar 
									[use Tstar for AGN or -Tstar for input spec]
Distance [kpc]							#distance to the source
Velocity [km/s]							#expansion velocity
A	B	C	D	E	THcrit/F 		#dfunc parameters, thcrit is bicone angle
									 see dfunc.f90
Tau0	N0							#optical depth along equator, n_0th wavelength in the grid
Rmin (F1)	Rmax/Rmin (F2)	Rsw/Rmin(F3)			#in arcsec, minimum shell radius, 
								 ratio of max to Rmin, ratio of super wind to Rmin	
									Rsw will only be used if it is defined in dfunc.90	
Nlayer								#number of layers
Rlayer1	Rlayer2	..... Rmin					#location of composition boundries

***try using Double precision version of 2dust if the ratio of outer to inner dust
shell radius is > 200

datafiles.dat:  The source of all the input/output names/files.
		These file names are just the ROOT name  and they are
		all assumed to have a '.dat' suffix

0 		! Interactive mode switch [IOFLAG]
shell 		! Input parameter file name [FNAME]
specgrid 	! Wavelength grid file name [SPEC]
quad45		! theta directional Quadrature file name [QUAD]
shell_stuff 	! Default output file name [STUFF]
dprop 		! Dust properties file name [PROP]
xsec 		! Cross sections file name [XSEC]


dprop.dat should have the following form:

1 0 							! XFLAG, NFLAG	
2 							! NGTYPE for layer 1
1 3.2 0.50 3.5 0.001 1.0 nk_dorschner95_olmg40.dat 	! SD RHO MASSWT GAMMA Amin Amax NKFILE
1 3.2 0.50 3.5 0.001 1.0 nk_dwsuvSil.optical_rev 	! SD RHO MASSWT GAMMA Amin Amax NKFILE
2 							! NGTYPE for layer 2
2 3.2 0.50 3.5 0.001 1.0 nk_dorschner95_olmg40.dat 	! SD RHO MASSWT GAMMA Amin Amax NKFILE
2 3.2 0.50 3.5 0.001 1.0 nk_dwsuvSil.optical_rev 	! SD RHO MASSWT GAMMA Amin Amax NKFILE

XFLAG=1: MIE calculations performed and results WRITTEN to xsec file
XFLAT=0: previous cross-section calculations READ from xsec file
NFLAG=0: dust property averaging done over size space
NFLAG=1: Harrington averaging done for dust property
NFLAG=2: radiative transfer done with Harrington averaging, but after convergence emission contribution
	from each dust species is followed
NFLAG=3: Same as 2, but quantum heating is also accounted for with non-linear heating of small particles, contributions
	from these superheated dust grains is included.
	
		SizeQ.dat created: details dust-size and corresponding Q values
		XsecEXP.dat create: records cross-sections for each size and wavelength

NGTYPE: number of grain species in the first layer
SD=1: MRN function used, amin and amax define the range of the size distributions, gamma sets the power coefficient
SD=2: KMH function used, amin sets the lower limit of the size distribution, amax sets the exponential factor in the fall off function
	size-space integration done from amin to infinity
MASSWT: mass weight of the species (the sum of mass weights in a layer must be 1)

**number density at a given location is multiplied by the cross section to get the optical depth

NKFILE: the name for each n & k file (in the form  "wavelength  n  k ")
 

xsec.dat: ( avgmass[g cm -3], wavelength[um], k-absorption cross sec[cm2], sigma - scattering cross section[cm2], G - asymmetric parameter)
	the above line repeats for each wavelength, then
        the whole set repeats for each layer
	avgmass is the size and composition averaged mass 
	


specgrid.dat: (wavelength)
      specified in this file

sourceflux.dat: This is for inputting a spectrum into the code, the file must
	        be of the form:

		Luminosity of the source (in Lsun)
		Wavelength (microns)   Flux (Jy)

		repeat the second line for all wavelengths
	

  **the n&k values MUST cover the entire wavelength range you have in specgrid.dat
  if they dont, 2dust will attemp to extrapolate the needed values with a spline fit.
  	still investigating 2dust use of the spline fit. If in doubt, extrapolate the 
 	values for yourself so 2dust doesn't have to.

ADDITIONAL USEFULL INFORMATION
******************************

const.f90:  defines the constants used in calculations

	CONDITION: sets the convergence condition. When the fractional change between the luminosities of
		the current and previous iterations at each radial grid is less than CONDITION, the current
 		model has converged and the iteration is terminated
	NSIZE: defines the number of grids in the size space. The temp of dust grains will be followed for those NSIZE grain sizes
		execution time is proportional to NSIZE when in expanded quantum heating mode

	look-up tables are used to set dust temperature and intensity 

		NGRID: defines the size of the look-up table
		TBOT: lower range of table (minimum temp)
		TTOP: upper range of table (max temp)
